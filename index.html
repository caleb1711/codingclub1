                Learn To CODE With Us
            </h2>
            <p>
                There’s no denying that technology now dominates a huge amount of different industries. Being computer
                illiterate just
                won’t cut it any more in the world of work. And ‘learning to code’ seems to be the buzzword at the
                moment.
                Computer programming is a valuable and highly transferable skill in many professional settings. Even if
                you don't work
                for a technology company or IT department, you can benefit from gaining this technical skill. If you're
                interested in
                developing this skill, it might be helpful to learn why you should learn programming and what benefits
                it can offer.

                </h5>
                <p>
                    With programming skills, you can potentially design applications that allow you to be a more
                    efficient employee. You can
                    write code to automate processes you do regularly, allowing your computer to work in the
                    background while you focus on
                    tasks that require human input. You can also develop apps or websites that customers can access
                    or download. This
                    scalability can potentially enhance your reach compared to physical stores or advertisements,
                    which require customers to
                    be in specific physical locations.

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Your programming skills can be helpful if you want to start your own business. You can work as a
                    freelance programmer or
                    use your coding skills to support any other business you start. For example, you might be able to
                    build and customize
                    your website or run an online storefront without hiring a website designer. As a freelancer, you can
                    design and run
                    websites for others, create independent applications or sell training courses or one-on-one
                    mentorships to other people
                    who want to learn to code.

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Because computers run much of the modern world, developing programming skills can help you
                    understand how many things
                    work around you. For example, you might be able to keep up with developments in computing and
                    automation and advise
                    friends and family about new technologies that interest them or with which they need assistance. If
                    you have children,
                    you might better understand the applications and online teaching tools they use in school and help
                    them navigate those
                    technologies more efficiently.

                    Develop problem-solving Skills <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Coding relies fundamentally on problem-solving. Because there
                    are multiple approaches to writing code for a given situation,
                    learning programming can help you develop your problem-solving
                    skills as you think and work through different solutions. The
                    flexibility inherent in coding can help you practice looking
                    at a problem from many perspectives and generating several
                    possible answers. Creative problem-solving is a skill that
                    can transfer to other aspects of your work and daily life.

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Something as small as a missing punctuation mark can disrupt a piece
                    of code. Learning to code could help you develop
                    your attention to detail because it requires you to look quickly
                    and methodically for these potential errors. You can
                    also practice avoiding making these mistakes in the first place.

                <p>
                    Programming has the potential to be a very creative field. You can generate code from nothing,
                    starting with only your
                    goals for the final product. Because of the open nature of coding, you can experiment with various
                    codes to produce the
                    most efficient one while still achieving your goals. You can also use your programming skills to
                    enhance your other
                    creative pursuits, for example, by building games.
